With the current mentorship parameters, there are only 1,549 employees that would be eligible to be a mentor. That's a large ratio of open positions to be filled to mentors. Perhaps adjusting the parameters to be a mentor from employee's date of birth to the number of years in the employee's position would yield a wider rage of eligible mentors.
